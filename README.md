# Advanced time series analysis in R

The goal of the study is a comparative analysis of risk understood as an estimation of the conditional function of variance in GARCH class models.
A wallet consisting of four cryptocurrencies was built, in which each day the percentages of each of them are proportional
to their market capitalization and a comparative analysis of the conditional variance function estimates in the in-sample period and
Value-at-risk estimates obtained with the considered GARCH models in the out-of-sample period.

The project was prepared for the subject of ['Advanced time-series analysis'](https://usosweb.wne.uw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&prz_kod=2400-M1IiEZASC) for my master's studies.
